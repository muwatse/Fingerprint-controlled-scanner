Fingerprint-Controlled Medication Dispenser

An Arduino-based smart medication management device designed to help elderly users and arthritis patients securely and easily access their prescribed medication. The system uses biometric authentication, a keypad interface, and a precise dispensing mechanism to improve safety, accessibility, and adherence to medication schedules.

ðŸš€ Features

Biometric Security â€“ Integrated optical fingerprint scanner for authorized access.

User-Friendly Interface â€“ Backlit LED screen and keypad for scheduling and PIN entry.

Accurate Timekeeping â€“ Real-Time Clock (RTC) for precise dispensing at scheduled times.

Automated Dispensing â€“ Stepper motor and solenoid lock ensure one dose per dispense.

Accessibility-Driven Design â€“ Ergonomic 3D-printed enclosure designed for users with limited dexterity.

Modular Electronics â€“ Custom PCB for clean wiring and easy component replacement.
